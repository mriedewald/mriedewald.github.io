<h1 class="style1">NCTracer Web</h1>
<p class="style1">We design novel distributed algorithms and build an open-source software 
implementation of a Web-based system for collaborative automated and manual 
tracing of neurites from light-microscopy stacks of images. This is a joint 
project with the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/neurogeometry/">
Neurogeometry Lab</a> of Prof. Armen Stepanyants. It builds on the success of 
NCTracer, turning it from a standalone software that runs on a single machine to a collaborative 
and scalable system that makes the power of distributed (cloud) computing 
available to neuroscientists through a standard Web browser.</p>
<h2 class="style1">Problem Description</h2>
<h3 class="style1">The Driving Application: Brain Connectivity Analysis</h3>
<p><span class="style1">NCTracer Web is designed to support collaborative 
tracing and analysis of multi-terabyte-size brain images we receive from 
national and international collaborators. In addition to the concrete challenges 
posed by brain-connectivity analysis, we are designing distributed algorithms 
that also apply to other domains, e.g., social-network analysis and SQL database 
queries.</span></p>

<p class="style1">Light-microscopic imaging of a mouse brain produces about 
20,000 3D image stacks, each typically 1024x1024x312 voxels and covering about 
0.26x0.26x0.8 micrometers<sup>3</sup>, for a total of about 10 terabytes of TIFF 
data. These image stacks overlap, but their microscope-recorded positions and 
orientation are not sufficiently precise. For scientific analysis, the following 
major processing steps are required:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">Registration: Turn the individual stacks into a coherent 
	3D image of the entire brain, ensuring correct connections across stack 
	boundaries.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">Automatic and manual tracing: Convert the image into a 
	graph that represents axons and dendrites as nodes and edges. This is 
	challenging in dense regions where many connections cross. Since manual 
	tracing is too slow, we follow a combined approach of scalable automatic 
	tracing, followed by manual tracing to correct potential errors.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">Graph analytics: Once the image is represented as a graph, 
	we can explore its structure, e.g., find common patterns or determine the 
	region of influence of a neuron.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="style1">In addition to static full-brain images, we also have access 
to time-series data taken periodically over a large time span in the same 
animal. These images cover only a fraction of the brain and only the outer 1mm 
of it, but they enable studying dynamics of how synapses, which connect an axon 
of a neuron to the dendrite of another, form or disappear over time.</p>
<h3 class="style1">General Algorithmic Challenges</h3>
<p class="style1">

fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography, Optics Express, 21(8): 
9839-9850, 2013)</p>
<p class="style1">Motivated by the brain-data analysis application and by 
potential applications to other domains, we are studying algorithmic challenges 
such as:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">Image alignment in space and time: Align 20,000 3D image 
	stacks <em>in space</em> and do this efficiently in a distributed system 
	with tens or hundreds of machines. Align time-series data in <em>space and 
	time</em>. What are general principles that apply to these two and other 
	image-alignment problems so that new alignment challenges require only minor 
	customization instead of having to design a completely new approach from 
	scratch?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">Top-k pattern search in graphs: Identify common structural 
	patterns and search for specific graph patterns. When the number of result 
	patterns is very large, we want to quickly return the most relevant 
	patterns, then keep returning the next-most-relevant pattern instances until 
	the user is satisfied.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">Distributed joins: Joins are crucial for pattern search 
	and correlation finding. Design effective distributed algorithms for common 
	types of joins, including equi-join and band-join, but also the general 
	theta-join. Can we prove near-optimality properties, e.g., for the largest 
	amount of load assigned to any machine in the system?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">Evolving graphs: What is the best way to store, manage, 
	and query evolving graphs?</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="style1">Publications and Software</span></h2>
<p><span class="style1">We have a variety of strong initial results, including 
provably near-optimal algorithms for distributed theta-joins and equi-joins. The 
latter (as of late 2019) represent the best known distributed equi-join 
algorithms---in terms of running time---for skewed input. However, many open 
research problems are waiting for curious and motivated PhD students and post 
docs. And we also have projects for undergraduate and Masters students.</span></p>
<p class="style1">The current version of our NCTracer Web system demo is running
<a href="https://129.10.48.247/NCT-Web/">here</a>. (We recommend using the 
Chrome browser.) It is under development, therefore may be running at a 
different address. Here is how it looked as of late September 2019:</p>
