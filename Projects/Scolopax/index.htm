<h1 class="style1">The Scolopax Project<img alt="Scolopax logo" class="style3" height="156" src="../../images/ScolopaxLogo-160.jpg" style="float: right" width="160" /></h1>
<p class="style1">Data-intensive science is concerned with 
collecting, archiving, and analyzing the vast amounts of data being produced and 
accumulated by modern science. Turning scientific raw data into knowledge will 
be the key for future scientific discoveries. A typical data-intensive science 
project has the following major steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li class="style1">Collection and creation of raw data, e.g., from sensors, human 
	observers, and simulations</li>
	<li class="style1">Combination of different datasets to create a task-specific input 
	dataset</li>
	<li class="style1">Exploratory analysis to discover new patterns</li>
	<li class="style1">Confirmatory analysis, e.g., creating new hypotheses from discovered 
	patterns and testing these hypotheses on <em>newly collected data</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="style1">The focus of Scolopax is on </span>
<span class="style2">exploratory analysis</span><span class="style1">. An 
essential aspect of exploratory analysis is the use of non-parametric (or 
semi-parametric) data mining techniques. These techniques enable scientists to 
train accurate prediction models of complex processes even in the absence of a 
complete understanding of these processes. Using such models for analysis is 
preferable compared to simply summarizing the raw data directly. A model with 
good generalization performance does not overfit to noise or a specific data 
sample and hence captures the natural process more accurately. Unfortunately, 
complex prediction models per se are not intelligible. They cannot be used 
directly for answering questions like 'Which environmental features have the 
strongest effect on bird abundance and how do they interact?'. To make data 
mining models 'digestible' and to provide end users with new hypotheses, we need 
to 'open up the blackbox', i.e., provide tools for determining important 
relationships that the model has learned. This can be done by summarizing a 
complex model with simpler patterns like partial dependence functions. The 
number of such model summaries is overwhelming: each 'slice' or 'dice' of a 
lower-dimensional subspace of the original data space could contain an 
interesting model summary.</span></p>
<p class="style1"><span class="auto-style1">Warning</span>: Since Scolopax can 
rapidly explore a large search space, it is prone to discovering <em>spurious 
patterns</em> as well real ones. Good scientific practice requires all patterns 
discovered to be verified on newly collected data, i.e., based on a specially 
designed experiment where the pattern informs the hypothesis. At the very least, 
consult your friendly neighborhood domain expert before getting too excited 
about a surprising new pattern :)</p>
<p class="style1">
<img alt="Scolopax overview" height="435" src="../../images/ScolopaxOverview.gif" width="876" /></p>
<p class="style1">The Scolopax project addresses various data management 
challenges to enable 
exploratory analysis (see system overview above). Scientists will be able to express 
their exploration preferences in a user-friendly language. The preference 
specification will then be automatically transformed into a formal query, for 
which Scolopax finds an efficient execution plan for a multi-processor 
environment like a cluster or Cloud. Other Scolopax components are concerned 
with post-processing of the discovered patterns and efficient training of data 
mining models. Our approach is validated through our ongoing collaboration with 
the <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a>, using 
citizen science data and other data resources organized by the ornithological 
community in the <a target="_top" href="http://www.avianknowledge.net/">Avian Knowledge Network</a> 
(AKN).</p>
<h2 class="style1">System Prototype</h2>

<p class="style1">The Scolopax system is briefly described in a
<a href="../../papers/2013-VLDB-ScolopaxDemo.pdf">demonstration paper</a> 
published at VLDB 2013. It currently consists of four different components: 
Summary Ranker, Cluster Ranker, Correlation Finder, and Performance Monitor. All 
four components work with summaries that are generated on-the-fly for a data mining model. 
This model was trained on a large 
high-dimensional
<a href="http://www.avianknowledge.net/content/features/archive/eBird_Ref">data 
set</a> containing crowd-sourced data about bird sightings reported by citizen scientists through the
<a href="http://www.ebird.org">eBird</a> project. Processing happens in parallel 
on a 44-core cluster running the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> 
version of MapReduce. Results from previous analyzes are stored in an HBase 
database on the same cluster to speed up future queries.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Summary Ranker</strong>: version 
<a href="SummaryRanker.htm">with frames</a> or
<a href="http://129.10.112.225:8080/ScolopaxWebVLDB/">without frames</a>. This 
component supports search for interesting model summaries. Each summary is a 
partial-dependence plot on some summary attribute, visualizing the effect of 
this attribute on the observation probability of some bird species by taking the 
average effect of all other attributes into account. For instance, a strong 
down-trend in the summary for YEAR suggests a decline of the species in the 
corresponding region. The user can select bird species, regions of interest, and 
a measure to rank the model summaries created for different attributes by their 
&quot;interestingness&quot;. (Scolopax will generate and rank all one-dimensional 
summaries according to the specifications.) After the ranked list of results is 
presented, the user can post-process it by filtering out groups of summaries 
that are not of interest. 
The summary ranker uses <a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</a> 
to store and manage query results. If a submitted query and ranking measure are 
found in the database, the old results are re-used, speeding up processing 
significantly. If the same query is used with a different ranking measure, some 
speedup is achieved since existing summaries are re-used, but 
have to be re-ranked on-the-fly. For new queries, all summaries are computed 
from scratch and ranked on-the-fly.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Cluster Ranker</strong>: version 
<a href="ClusterRanker.htm">with frames</a> or
<a href="http://129.10.112.225:8080/ScolopaxWebClusteringVLDB/">without frames</a>. 
This component supports the discovery of spatio-temporal movements of bird 
species, in particular migration. It works with the same kind of model summaries 
as the Summary Ranker. Instead of ranking individual summaries, the Cluster 
Ranker first clusters summaries on temporal attributes by their similarity. Then 
the clusterings are ranked based on how different the cluster centers are from 
each other. (This indicates regionally different temporal trends.)</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Correlation Finder</strong>: version 
<a href="CorrelationFinder.htm">with frames</a> or
<a href="http://129.10.112.225:8080/ScolopaxWebJoinsVLDB/">without frames</a>. 
This component supports discovery of correlations between model summaries. It 
can be used to find potential habitat competition between species (find two 
species that show complementary abundance trends in a certain region over the 
years) and diverse migration trends (find two species with different seasonal 
pattern of abundance). The correlation finder also works with large sets of 
model summaries. Users specify a join query through an intuitive interface. The 
join result is computed in parallel using our
<a href="../../papers/2011-SIGMOD-ParallelJoins.pdf">recently proposed 
techniques</a>.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Performance Monitor</strong>: version 
<a href="PerformanceMonitor.htm">with frames</a> or
<a href="http://129.10.112.225:8080/ScolopaxWebPMVLDB/">without frames</a>. This 
component visualizes the performance improvement resulting from our research 
compared to the previous state of the art. It executes the summary ranker and 
continuously reports the progress in terms of summaries computed.</p>

SIGMOD Int. Conf. on Managament of Data, 2014 ]<br />
We propose the notion of anti-combining to reduce cost and hence optimize for 
throughput in MapReduce systems. Anti-combining pushes functionality from 
Mappers to Reducers in order to decrease network transfer and local disk I/O 
cost. This is achieved through syntactic re-writing that can be applied 
automatically to any given MapReduce program. The modified program then performs 
fine-grained local optimizations at runtime in order to reduce the cost of the 
data transfer between Mappers and Reducers. </p>

To find related summaries, we need flexible join operators, not just standard 
equi-joins. We developed novel techniques for efficiently computing arbitrary 
theta-joins in parallel, with particular focus on MapReduce systems. Our most 
general algorithm is randomized and provably achieves a near-optimal low latency. For popular join predicates, including equi-, 
inequality-, and epsilon-join, we present specialized techniques that work well, 
no matter how skewed the data distribution.</span></p>

Model summaries form the basis for exploratory analysis. For a typical analysis, 
millions to billions of such summaries have to be created. We show how to 
exploit workload properties to reduce computation time asymptotically, perform 
fast batch computation, and effectively parallelize the workload in MapReduce.</span></p>

Finding relevant frequent patterns in bursty sequences is expensive and suffers

regarding preservation of interesting sequences.</p>

Model summaries inherently lose information compared to the full model. To 
better understand when a summary might be hiding important information, we need 
to understand which variables strongly interact. Our techniques identify such 
variables using a mostly non-parametric approach.</p>

While traditional data mining research usually focused on model accuracy and 
training cost, exploratory analysis shifts the bottleneck to the prediction 
phase, when the model is actually being used. We propose approximation techniques 
that significantly speed up precition time, while 
maintaining high prediction accuracy.</p>
