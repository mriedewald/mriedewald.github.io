<p><span class="style1"><strong>Data:</strong></span> <span class="style1">
<a href="http://www.avianknowledge.net/content/features/archive/eBird_Ref" target="_blank">eBird 
Reference Dataset</a> (description also available
<a href="../../papers/ebird-ref-data.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>)</span></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Goal:</strong> Find interesting patterns that suggest how observed bird presence depends 
on variables (aka attributes) describing habitat, climate, land cover, human 
population etc.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Current functionality:</strong> The system creates and searches one-dimensional 
summaries of a high-dimensional model trained on the eBird Reference Dataset. 
Intuitively the summary on an attribute A represents the effect of A on the 
output, taking into account the average effect of all other attributes. This is 
usually referred to as a partial dependence summary. By default the summaries 
are computed for the entire data space. To discover patterns that are spatially 
or temporally &quot;local&quot;, it is possible to create summaries for spatio-temporal 
partitions of the data space. <strong>Notice</strong> that even though all 
computations happen in parallel on 44 CPU cores, it might take a minute to 
create and rank 100,000 summaries (more time for more summaries).</p>
