<h3 class="style2">How to use it:</h3>
<p class="style2">Query Input tab</p>
<p class="style2"><span class="auto-style1"><strong>CAREFUL</strong></span>: 
correlation search can be expensive as there are n<sup>2</sup> possible pairs 
for n summaries. E.g., if there are 100,000 summaries, Scolopax might have to 
explore up to 10 billion pairs!</p>
<ol>
	<li><span class="style2">Select species of interest</span><ol>
		<li class="style2">Use control+click to add another species</li>
		<li class="style2">Use shift+click to add range of species</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><span class="style2">Select region and partitioning of interest</span></li>
	<li class="style2">Compose a join conditions to find related pairs of 
	summaries<ol>
		<li class="style2">Correlation finds similar summaries, 
		anti-correlations finds those most different from each other.</li>
		<li class="style2">The species join condition limits the summary pairs 
		considered to those where both species are (not) the same.</li>
		<li class="style2">The region join condition limits the summary pairs 
		considered to those that are (not) for the same geographical region.</li>
		<li class="style2">The epsilon value eliminates poor matches. If you are 
		not sure how to set it, choose a large value, e.g., 100, for correlation 
		search and zero for anti-correlation search. Then decrease (correlation 
		search) or increase (anti-correlation search) it to reduce result size.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li class="style2">Submit</li>
	<li class="style2">The Predefined Queries section allows storing and 
	re-using of queries for future use. Re-execution will be faster, because 
	previous results are stored in HBase (but might be deleted at some point 
	when the database runs out of space.)</li>
</ol>
<p class="style2">Results tab</p>
<ol>
	<li class="style2">View the summary pairs patterns found, sorted by their 
	(anti-)correlation, measured as the distance between the lines after 
	shifting by mean (for shift-invariance).<ol>
		<li class="style2">When hovering over the plot line or title, the 
		corresponding region is highlighted on the map.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><span class="style2">Eliminate results from the list if desired</span></li>
	<ol>
		<li class="style2">In the filter panel, choose which results to remove. E.g., selecting 
		a species will remove all results for the species.</li>
		<li class="style2">Filters can be added and removed as desired.</li>
	</ol>
	<li class="style2">The settings panel allows plot settings to be changed. To 
	export a plot, un-select &quot;show interactive plots&quot;.</li>
	<li class="style2">The plots at the bottom of the results panel visualize 
	the distribution of input and output over the Reduce tasks (which perform 
	the actual join work) during join computation. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span class="style2">At any time, it is possible to go to another tab by simply clicking 
on it. However, </span> <span class="style1">if the browser's forward or back buttons 
are used, the previous state is lost</span><span class="style2">.</span></strong></p>
