		<strong>Research collaborations</strong>: I have been collaborating with
		industrial partners and with scientists from various disciplines since 1999.
		While specific challenges vary, there is always the same common theme: everybody
		is collecting and generating an ever
		increasing amount of data. In this world of big data and of data-driven science,
		groundbreaking discoveries depend on the ability to efficiently analyze and
		process these massive amounts of data. We have been designing scalable data
		management and analysis techniques for neuroscience, discovery and linking of
		personal information (e.g., as mandated by GDPR), ornithology, ecology, rocket
		science (really!), astronomy, and high-energy physics---to name a few.

	<p class="style7"><strong>Research vision</strong>: Create algorithms that <em>
			scale</em> in the size and complexity of data, with a focus on analysis problems
		motivated by grand challenges in Open Data and data-driven science.</p>

		<a href="https://db.khoury.northeastern.edu/">DATA Lab</a> @ Northeastern.
		Currently he focuses on the development of novel techniques for
		large-scale distributed data analysis, data management, and data mining. His
		research agenda is driven by collaborations with domain scientists and industry,
		with the goal to produce results that are publishable in both premier computer
		science venues as well as those in the application domain.

	<h4 class="style7"><a href="https://northeastern-datalab.github.io/distributed/">Distributinator: Scalable Big-Data
			Analytics</a></h4>
	<p class="style7">How do we effectively and efficiently use many machines in a
		cluster or in a cloud to solve a big-data-analysis challenge? What is the best
		way to partition a dataset so that running time of the distributed computation
		is minimized? How do we abstract a complex distributed computation so that we
		can learn a mathematical model of how running time depends on parameters
		affecting data partitioning?</p>
	<h4 class="style7"><a href="https://northeastern-datalab.github.io/anyk/">Any-k:
			Optimal Ranked Enumeration for Conjunctive Queries</a></h4>
	<p class="style7">When a query on big data produces huge output, can we quickly
		return the &quot;most important&quot; results without even computing the entire output? If
		the notion of importance is difficult to define, can we return the top-ranked
		results so quickly that the user can try out different options (nearly)
		interactively? For what types of queries and data can this functionality be
		supported? And what are the best time and space guarantees we can
		provide?</p>
	<h4 class="style7"><a href="https://northeastern-datalab.github.io/whynotyet/">Why Not Yet: Algorithmic Fairness for
			Individuals and Groups</a></h4>
	<p class="style7">We are interested in exploring and correcting the impact AI tools have on our everyday lives,
		especially in the context of algorithmic fairness for ranking. Individuals and institutions have long used
		rankings for decision-making, e.g., to determine who gets a job, who is admitted to a university, which
		university to apply to, and even to pick the best basketball players of all time. While it is convenient to rely
		on data and algorithms to produce such rankings, we must establish guardrails to prevent unintended outcomes. In
		this project, we investigate acceptable notions and measures of fairness, and devise mechanisms for ensuring
		that algorithms behave accordingly. One result is a novel fairness definition based on the qualifications of
		individual entities. It complements previous work, which explored target ranges for the representation of groups
		in the top positions of a ranking. We also study techniques for explaining and debugging an undesirable ranking
		and the function used to assign scores to entities. Unlike rankings generated by complex AI approaches that are
		difficult to understand, we focus on linear functions and attempt to use powerful formal methods in a way that
		allows our approach to scale to big data.</p>
	<h4 class="style7"><a href="https://northeastern-datalab.github.io/table-as-query/">Table-as-Query:
			unifying Data Discovery and Alignment</a></h4>
	<p class="style7">Fueled by advances in information extraction and societal
		trends that value institutional openness and transparency, structured data are
		being produced and shared at an overwhelming speed. Open-data sharing is central
		to supporting institutional transparency, but transparency is not achieved if
		shared data cannot be found and effectively aligned with other data being
		studied by data scientists, journalists, and others. This project will
		fundamentally contribute to the new science of open-data sharing by laying the
		theoretical foundations of data discovery and by designing a system that solve
		the problem at scale.</p>
	<h4 class="style7"><a href="Projects/NCTracerWeb/index.htm">NCTracer Web</a></h4>
	<p class="style7">How do we turn 20,000 3D image stacks (10 terabytes per mouse
		brain) taken by a high-resolution light microscope into a coherent 3D image of
		the brain? How do we extract from this massive dataset a graph representing the
		neurons captured in the image? And how do we analyze this graph efficiently? Can
		we extend this approach to include other brain data, e.g., from fMRI and
		electron microscopes? And can we generalize our techniques to graph problems in
		other domains such as social network analysis?</p>
