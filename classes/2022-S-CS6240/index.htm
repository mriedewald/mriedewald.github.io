<h2>CS 6240: Large-Scale Parallel Data Processing</h2>
<p>Covers big-data-analysis techniques that scale out with increasing number of 
compute nodes, e.g., for cloud computing. Focuses on approaches for problem and 
data partitioning that distribute work effectively while keeping total cost for 
computation and data transfer low. Deterministic and random algorithms from a 
variety of domains, including graphs, data mining, linear algebra, and 
information retrieval, are studied and analyzed in terms of their cost, 
scalability, and robustness against skew. Coursework emphasizes hands-on 
programming experience with modern state-of-the-art big-data-processing 
technology. Students who do not meet course prerequisites may seek permission of 
instructor. </p><hr>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>Most aspects of the course are managed through Canvas (<a href="https://canvas.northeastern.edu/">https://canvas.northeastern.edu/</a>). 
In Canvas you will find links to all other relevant services:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gradescope: Assignments will be available there and you submit your 
	solution in Gradescope as well.</li>
	<li>GitHub Classroom repositories for your homework and project source code.</li>
	<li>Piazza for all asynchronous discussions.</li>
	<li>Zoom meetings for office hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <strong>do not email your 
course-related questions or concerns</strong>, but post everything in the Piazza discussion board. 
To reach 
only the instructor and TAs, e.g., with a grading-related question, make your 
Piazza post private and set the appropriate visibility.</p>

<h3>Course Material</h3>
<p>Please read the <a href="2022-S-CS6240-Syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> carefully.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="../CS6240-stable/index.htm">this page</a> for the online 
modules. Please make sure you go through the material <span class="auto-style2">
<strong>before</strong></span> the week it is discussed in class.</p>
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>See Zoom meeting links in Canvas.</p>
<h3>Important dates</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Exam</strong>: Monday, April 11 or Thursday, April 14. The exam takes place in the 
	classroom during the regular lecture time.</li>
	<li><strong>Project presentations</strong>: Due to the ongoing pandemic, 
	most likely instead of project presentations in class, we will ask all teams 
	to submit their presentation as a recorded video. (If we are able to have 
	in-class presentations, we generally try to schedule all 
	presentations for the Monday of the last week of classes so that students are done with CS 
	6240 coursework as early as possible. However, this depends on room 
	availability and the Registrar will not give us a room until very late in 
	the semester. Hence unless the instructor officially announces a new 
	time/location, by default all project presentations are currently scheduled 
	to take place during the last week of classes on the same time/day of the week as the 
	regular lectures.)</li>
