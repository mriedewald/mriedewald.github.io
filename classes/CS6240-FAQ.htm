<h2>CS 6240 FAQ</h2>
<p><strong><a name="Waiver"></a>General note: Often we get a large number of 
inquiries about course registration, the waitlist, pre-reqs, and waivers. 
Unfortunately we are not able to respond to all these requests in a timely 
manner: unlike the techniques and technologies we teach in CS 6240, the 
instructor cannot parallelize himself. This means that during particularly busy 
times of research, student advising, course preparation, and university service, 
the instructor simply cannot keep up with the flood of incoming emails, Teams 
messages, Slack messages, and so on. We apologize for this in advance.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am a PhD student in CS, ECE, or a closely related field 
with good algorithms and programming background. Can I take the course?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we can generally waive the pre-reqs for PhD students like you. If you are not 
sure, contact me directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I am a Masters student whose curriculum includes a graduate-level 
algorithms course like CS 5800 or ECE 7205. I would like to take CS 6240 before 
(or concurrently with) that algorithms course. Can I get a 
waiver for the algorithms pre-req?</strong></p>
<p>Usually not, because we do not have the time and resources to carefully check 
your level of preparation for CS 6240. We want to make sure that you will be ready 
to succeed, and this requires a solid background in algorithms. Since you need 
to take a graduate-level algorithms course anyway, we ask that you take that 
course early on, so that you are ready for CS 6240 and do not need a waiver.</p>
<p>We understand that sometimes there are special circumstances. In that case, 
contact me and briefly explain your situation (explain clearly why you cannot 
take the algorithms course before taking CS 6240). For a waiver, we look at your 
GPA here at Northeastern (it should be near 4.0), in particular for related courses 
like databases, machine learning, data mining, and information retrieval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I took an algorithms course as an undergraduate student. Isn't that 
enough for waiving the algorithms pre-req?</strong></p>
<p>It should be, but in our experience actual working knowledge of algorithms 
material varied. For that reason we introduced the pre-reqs, because we want you 
to succeed. If you took the undergraduate-level algorithms course recently at a 
university the instructor is familiar with (which typically means it is a 
research university in the US or top-tier university in another country), and 
you received a very good grade in that course, then we may consider a waiver.</p>

<p><strong>The course title and description do not mention MapReduce, Spark, etc. 
What technologies will be covered?</strong></p>
<p>We did not include specific technologies in course title and description, so that we 
can react to the changing technology landscape without having to repeatedly 
update the Registrar information. The course teaches distributed algorithms for 
big-data processing, which can be implemented in many different languages and 
platforms. Currently we work with Hadoop 
MapReduce and Spark.</p>
