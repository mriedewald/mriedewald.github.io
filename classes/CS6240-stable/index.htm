	<h2>CS 6240: Large-Scale Parallel Data Processing</h2>

	<p>
		Covers big-data analysis techniques that scale out with increasing number of
		compute nodes, e.g., for cloud computing. Focuses on approaches for problem and
		data partitioning that distribute work effectively while keeping total cost for
		computation and data transfer low. Deterministic and random algorithms from a
		variety of domains, including graphs, data mining, linear algebra, and
		information retrieval, are studied and analyzed in terms of their cost,
		scalability, and robustness against skew. Coursework emphasizes hands-on
		programming experience with modern state-of-the-art big-data processing
		technology. Students who do not meet course prerequisites may seek permission of
		instructor.
