<h2>CS 6240: Parallel Data Processing in MapReduce</h2>
<p>This course covers techniques for analyzing very large data sets. We 
introduce the MapReduce programming model and the core technologies it relies on 
in practice, such as a distributed file system. Related approaches and 
technologies from distributed databases and Cloud Computing will also be 
introduced. Particular emphasis is placed on practical examples and hands-on 
programming experience. Both plain MapReduce and database-inspired advanced 
programming models running on top of a MapReduce infrastructure will be used.</p><hr>
