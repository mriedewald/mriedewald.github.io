<h2>CS 6240: Large-Scale Parallel Data Processing</h2>
<p>Covers big-data analysis techniques that scale out with increasing number of 
compute nodes, e.g., for cloud computing. Focuses on approaches for problem and 
data partitioning that distribute work effectively while keeping total cost for 
computation and data transfer low. Deterministic and random algorithms from a 
variety of domains, including graphs, data mining, linear algebra, and 
information retrieval, are studied and analyzed in terms of their cost, 
scalability, and robustness against skew. Coursework emphasizes hands-on 
programming experience with modern state-of-the-art big-data processing 
technology. Students who do not meet course prerequisites may seek permission of 
instructor. </p><hr>
