<h2>CS 7290: Special Topics in Data Science</h2>
<p>This course covers research topics in analysis and management of big data, 
with a focus on distributed/parallel approaches and imprecise 
data/approximation. It is designed for PhD students and advanced Masters 
students with a strong background in computer science. A desired outcome of the 
course project is the creation of research results that are publishable in a 
peer-reviewed conference.</p>
<p><strong>A note to first and second year PhD students</strong>: Prof. 
Gatterbauer is actively looking for multiple PhD students to work with him. This 
course provides an excellent opportunity to explore relevant topics.</p>
<p><strong>Instructors</strong>: Prof. Wolfgang Gatterbauer and Prof.
<a href="../../../index.htm">Mirek Riedewald</a></p>
<p><strong>Course format</strong>: Lectures typically will be a mix of (1) 
presentation of material by the instructors (e.g., to introduce a research 
area), (2) presentation of research papers by instructors and/or students, and 
(3) interactive discussion of these papers.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: For CCIS PhD students, there are no formal 
requirements other than an interest in the topics covered. For PhD students from 
other programs and MS students, instructor approval is required. This will be 
done case-by-case, usually based on strong performance (grade A) in CCIS 
graduate-level courses on big data topics (or equivalent outside CCIS).</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: Grades are based on (1) quality of in-class 
presentation, (2) participation in discussions (in-class, online), and (3) 
quality of course project. We currently envision the presentation to be done by 
individuals or 2-person teams; and the project by teams of size 1 to 3.</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary list of topics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Overview of research topics in big data analysis and management</li>
	<li>Parallel and distributed query processing: lower bounds, algorithms, 
	systems</li>
	<li>Provenance</li>
	<li>Scalable techniques for machine learning</li>
	<li>Imprecise and probabilistic data: learning, cleaning</li>
	<li>Approximate query processing</li>
	<li>Factorized databases</li>
