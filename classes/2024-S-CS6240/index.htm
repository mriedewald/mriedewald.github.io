	<h2>CS 6240: Large-Scale Parallel Data Processing</h2>
	<p>
		Covers big-data-analysis techniques that scale out with increasing number of
		compute nodes, e.g., for cloud computing. Focuses on approaches for problem and
		data partitioning that distribute work effectively while keeping total cost for
		computation and data transfer low. Deterministic and random algorithms from a
		variety of domains, including graphs, data mining, linear algebra, and
		information retrieval, are studied and analyzed in terms of their cost,
		scalability, and robustness against skew. Coursework emphasizes hands-on
		programming experience with modern state-of-the-art big-data-processing
		technology. Students who do not meet course prerequisites may seek permission of
		instructor.

	<p>
		Most aspects of the course are managed through Northeastern Canvas
		(<a href="https://canvas.northeastern.edu/">https://northeastern.instructure.com/</a>).
		There you will find links to most other relevant services:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Gradescope: Assignments will be available there and you submit your solution in Gradescope.</li>
		<li>GitHub Classroom repositories for your homework and project source code.</li>
		<li>Online discussion forum for all asynchronous discussions.</li>
		<li>Zoom meetings for office hours.</li>
	</ul>

	In addition to the Northeastern Canvas, we will also use Amazon's Canvas instance.
	This is how Amazon now makes their free AWS credits accessible for courses.
