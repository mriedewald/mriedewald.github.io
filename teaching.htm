			Graduate course. Covers big-data analysis techniques that scale out
			with increasing number of compute nodes, e.g., for cloud computing. Focuses on
			approaches for problem and data partitioning that distribute work
			effectively while keeping total cost for computation and data transfer low.
			Deterministic and random algorithms from a variety of domains, including
			graphs, data mining, linear algebra, and information retrieval, are studied
			and analyzed in terms of their cost, scalability, and robustness against
			skew. Coursework emphasizes hands-on programming experience with modern
			state-of-the-art big-data processing technology. Students who do not meet
			course prerequisites may seek permission of instructor.

			context-free languages, pushdown
			automata, and noncontext-free languages. The computability portion includes
			Turing machines, the Church-Turing thesis, decidable languages, and the
			Halting theorem. The complexity portion includes big-O and small-o notation,
			the classes P and NP, the P vs. NP question, and NP-completeness.</li>

		<li class="style1">This course provides a rigorous introduction to the
			algorithms, core principles, and foundational concepts for managing data at
			scale. The emphasis is on both, the high-level theoretical intuitions and
			principles underlying scalable data management, as well as technical
			details. Topics include data models and query languages, query optimization,
			complexity of big-data analysis, data-stream processing, parallel data
			processing, and probabilistic data management. Students will gain deep
			algorithmic understanding through interactive classes and a project with
			regular feedback. The latter will be flexible, allowing students to explore
			scalable data management and analysis aspects related to their PhD research.

			discuss and analyze papers covering applications, algorithms, systems, and
			theory--with a focus on the most recent developments. This course is
			designed for PhD students, as well as advanced Masters students with a solid
			background in algorithms and one or more data-oriented areas of computer
			science, incl. machine learning, AI, logics, information retrieval, and
			security. A desired outcome of the course project is the creation of
			research results that are publishable in a peer-reviewed conference.</li>
